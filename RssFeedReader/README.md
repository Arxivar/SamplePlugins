## User level settings and its default value

This plugin was created as a proof of concept of integration with external services and enhancement of a end user level plugin setting with default plugin level values.
The user can in fact choose the url feed of the reader on every desktop where this widget appears. These are automatically saved for the user connected and the specific desktop. The administrator can set the default value for url feed from the settings of the plugin available at
