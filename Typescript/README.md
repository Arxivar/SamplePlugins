## Installation

- open the terminal into your plugin folder and install the node_modules locally using the command:

_Remember: if you specify the path in the options, you'll not need to follow the steps below. Your plugin already running in ARXivar._

- now a new subfolder named '`(e.g. `CalendarWidget`)`' has been created, in this folder you will find the javascript compiled files. 

- When you finish to develope your plugin, you have to copy the compiled files folder mentioned above in Scripts/plugins/ (path of ARXivarPortal) in order to use it.(e.g. `MyDrive:\Program Files (x86)\Able Tech S.r.l\ARXivarNext WebPortal\Scripts\plugins`)

_Note: These plugins are provided as a support for learning activities, it's not recommended their use in production environment. Use them as a 'draft' for creating your plugins._
