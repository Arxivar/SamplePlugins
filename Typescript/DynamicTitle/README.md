## Plugin specification

This widget plugin Dynamically updates the Task V2 title by user Language and lock and unlock the outcome. It is designed for task workflows V2.

## Adding the plugin to a task layout

In order to add the plugin to a TASK layout, just edit your task layout and add the new widget `DynamicTitle`. Set the position and size you want.
_(the `DynamicTitle` entry is displayed along with all the preexisting widgets)_, then save the Task Layout. You can hide the map using the widgets settings.


## ARXivar configuration

This plugin was created as a proof of concept for task plugins.

In
```sh
ARXivar Next -> Admin (accessible only to administrative users) -> Plugins manager
```

The DynamicTitle plugin requires the creation of a specific process variable, follow the steps below to configure it:

1. Configure a boolean variable called "BooleanVariable."

2. In the task configuration, set the validation on the outcomes using the formula: [$BooleanVariable$] = true.

3. Set up an "Set process variables" operation containing our previously created variable (the operation can also be hidden).

4. Publish and run your workflow, then try the plugin.
